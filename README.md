# TC1031-PortafolioFinal
Hello! This repository is to keep track of the most important activities on my course: Data structures and fundamental algorithms. 

These activities evaluate my proficiency in the following competences:  
- SICT0301B Evaluates the components that make up a problem according to computational principles and processes.
- SICT0302B Makes decisions in solving problems under conditions of uncertainty and different levels of complexity based on research and computational methodologies.
- SICT0303B Implements scientific and engineering actions or computational processes that meet the type of solution required.
- SEG0702A Vanguard Technologies. Evaluates various technologies with openness to the search and implementation of relevant alternatives in the transformation of professional practice.

### Act 1.3
1. Open the input file called "bitacora.txt ", read it and store the data in a vector.  
Create a data structure (class) to store all the fields of the file.  
2. Sort the information by date to carry out searches.  
Lean on methods, attributes, and/or operator overloading in your class to handle the ordering of the file's records.  
3. Ask the user for the starting and ending dates of the information search (the interval must be closed, that is to include the values that delimit it), clearly indicating the format required by your program (ex. Jun 01 00:22:36).
Use the binary search algorithm to find the starting date of the range and then the ending date of the range selected for the query.  
Verify that both dates are in the log, in case one of them is not, inform the user.  
4. It displays on the screen the records corresponding to those dates.  
5. It stores in a file called "bitacora_ordenada.txt" the result of the ordering.  
6. 3 test cases are provided for you to verify your implementation: TestCasesAct1.3.zip

Investigate and reflect on the importance and efficiency of the use of the different ordering and search algorithms in a problem of this nature, generating a document called "ReflexAct1.3.pdf"
