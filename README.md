# TC1031-PortafolioFinal
This repository is to keep track of integrative evidences on my course: Data structures and fundamental algorithms. 

These activities evaluate my proficiency in the following competences:  
- SICT0301B Evaluates the components that make up a problem according to computational principles and processes.
- SICT0302B Makes decisions in solving problems under conditions of uncertainty and different levels of complexity based on research and computational methodologies.
- SICT0303B Implements scientific and engineering actions or computational processes that meet the type of solution required.
- SEG0702A Vanguard Technologies. Evaluates various technologies with openness to the search and implementation of relevant alternatives in the transformation of professional practice.
