### Act 1.3
1. Open the input file called "bitacora.txt ", read it and store the data in a vector.  
Create a data structure (class) to store all the fields of the file.  
2. Sort the information by date to carry out searches.  
Lean on methods, attributes, and/or operator overloading in your class to handle the ordering of the file's records.  
3. Ask the user for the starting and ending dates of the information search (the interval must be closed, that is to include the values that delimit it), clearly indicating the format required by your program (ex. Jun 01 00:22:36).
Use the binary search algorithm to find the starting date of the range and then the ending date of the range selected for the query.  
Verify that both dates are in the log, in case one of them is not, inform the user.  
4. Display on the screen the records corresponding to those dates.  
5. Store in a file called "bitacora_ordenada.txt" the result of the ordering.  
6. 3 test cases are provided for you to verify your implementation: TestCasesAct1.3.zip

Investigate and reflect on the importance and efficiency of the use of the different ordering and search algorithms in a problem of this nature, generating a document called "ReflexAct1.3.pdf"
